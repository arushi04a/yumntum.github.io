    <ol>
        <dl>
            <li>
                <dt>All-Purpose Flour:</dt>
                <dd>The structure of the cake. Unlike confetti cake where you can use either,<br>
                    do not use cake flour here—when combined with ultra-light cocoa powder, cake flour is too fine for
                    this cake</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Unsweetened Natural Cocoa Powder:</dt>
                <dd>Do not use dutch-process cocoa powder. If you’re interested, see dutch-process vs natural cocoa
                    powder for an in-depth explanation</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Baking Soda & Baking Powder:</dt>
                <dd> Remember the differences in baking soda vs baking powder? We use both here for lift</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Salt:</dt>
                <dd>Salt balances the flavor.</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Espresso Powder:</dt>
                <dd>Espresso powder is optional, but I recommend its addition because it enhances the chocolate flavor.
                    The chocolate cake will not taste like coffee,<br> I promise.
                    I use espresso powder in my chocolate zucchini cake, Guinness cake, chocolate raspberry cake, and
                    marble loaf cake too!</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Oil:</dt>
                <dd>Don’t use butter in this cake batter. Cocoa powder is a particularly drying ingredient, so this cake
                    needs oil for suitable moisture</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Eggs:</dt>
                <dd>Use 2 room temperature eggs. To speed up the gently warming, place refrigerated eggs in a cup of
                    warm water for 10 minutes. Did you know what the temperature of your ingredients has a direct
                    correlation to the success of your recipes?<br>
                    Unless otherwise noted, use room temperature ingredients</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Buttermilk:</dt>
                <dd>This chocolate cake requires the moisture and acidity from buttermilk. Lately I’ve been using a mix
                    of sour cream and buttermilk,<br>
                    as well as reducing the hot liquid. You can read more about this next and see my dark chocolate
                    mousse cake, tuxedo cake, black forest cake,<br>
                    German chocolate cake, and chocolate peanut butter cake recipes</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Hot Coffee or Hot Water:</dt>
                <dd> Hot liquid enhances the cocoa powder’s flavor. It also encourages it to bloom and dissolve
                    appropriately. You’ll notice I don’t use hot liquid in my chocolate cupcakes recipe. That’s because
                    there isn’t the same volume of dry ingredients. With this amount of cake batter, we need a hot
                    liquid to break up the cocoa powder lumps resting in all that flour.<br>
                    If you don’t drink coffee, you can use hot water. For deeper and darker flavor, though, use coffee.
                    Decaf coffee works!</dd>

    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans,<br>
            line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes
            seamlessly release from the pans.</li>
        <li>

            Make the cake: Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder
            (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk<br>
            attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until
            combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined.<br>
            Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed
            until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin
        <li>Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes
            out clean. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in
            the<br>
            center comes out clean. (Note: Even if they’re completely done, the cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in the
            center. Cocoa powder is simply not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour and can’t hold up to all
            the<br>
            moisture necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate cake. It’s normal!)</li>
        <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely in the pan</li>
        <li>
            Make the buttercream: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on
            medium speed until creamy—about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy<br>
            cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat
            for<br>
            1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is
            too<br>
            thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too thick. (I usually add 1 more.) Taste. Add
            another<br>
            pinch of salt if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble and frost: If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off
            the tops to create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished<br>
            cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top
            with<br>
            2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and
            bench<br>
            scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing to help set the shape. After that,
            you<br>
            can serve the cake or continue refrigerating for up to 4–6 hours before serving. Cake can be served at
            room<br>
            temperature or chilled
        </li>
